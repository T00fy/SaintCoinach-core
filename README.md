# Saint Coinach

This is a cross-platform fork of the Saint Coinach library using .net core.

Please see the original Saintcoinach repository if you need more information on how this program used to work.

Currently, only the command line utility is supported in this port. This utility is a rewwrite of the original one, but throws away the need for the terminal emulator that was in use by windows.

What currently works and compiles on .net core 7.0 (only linux tested)
- SaintCoinach core code
- SaintCoinach command line utility

Since this was expected mainly to be used for the Sapphire project, the feature set will be frozen to support version 3.3 of FFXIV.

## TODO
The Graphics utilities package
GUI application
